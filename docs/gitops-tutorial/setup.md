# Preparing for the tutorials

The tutorials within each lesson run against a Kubernetes cluster. This guide covers the one-time setup that deploys a cluster and installs everything the lessons need.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following command-line tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| **kubectl** | Kubernetes CLI | [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) |
| **git** | Version control | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |
| **curl** | HTTP requests | Usually pre-installed |

Additionally, if you are using the `--create-cluster` flag to have the script provision a local KinD cluster for you:

| Tool | Purpose | Install |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Docker** or **Podman** | Container runtime | [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)<br>[podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) |
| **KinD** (v0.20+) | Local Kubernetes clusters | [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) |

**System requirements:** ~10 GB of available memory for Docker/Podman when using `--create-cluster`.


## Cloning the repository

To get access to the lesson materials, first clone the streamshub-gitops repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/streamshub/streamshub-gitops.git
```

Next change into the lessons directory:

```
cd streamshub-gitops/lessons
```

## Setup

The simplest way to bootstrap the tutorial is to have the setup script create its own KinD cluster. You can also run the tutorial on a pre-existing cluster, by following those instruction. 

### Have the script create a local cluster 

Run the setup script from this directory:

```bash
00-setup/setup.sh --create-cluster
```

This takes approximately 8 minutes and creates a fully self-contained local environment:

1. A **KinD** Kubernetes cluster (`gitops-tutorial`) running on your machine
2. **ArgoCD** — the GitOps engine that watches Git and applies changes
3. **Strimzi** — the operator that manages Kafka resources on Kubernetes
4. **Gitea** — a lightweight Git server running inside the cluster, reachable at `http://localhost:3001`
5. A Git repository in Gitea containing the base Kafka configuration
6. An ArgoCD `Application` configured to watch that repository
7. A running Kafka cluster, already deployed via the GitOps workflow

When the script finishes, it prints the ArgoCD admin password and tells you which lesson prep script to run next.


### Using an existing cluster

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster (KinD set up differently, minikube, k3d, a remote cluster, etc.), you can skip local cluster provisioning entirely. This is the **default** behavior — running `./setup.sh` with no flags installs ArgoCD, Strimzi, and Gitea onto whatever `kubectl`'s current context points at, instead of creating a KinD cluster:

```bash
kubectl config use-context <your-context>
00-setup/setup.sh
```

Things to know when using an existing cluster:

* **The cluster is assumed to be dedicated to this tutorial.** Setup doesn't check for or try to coexist with a pre-existing ArgoCD/Strimzi/Gitea install.
* **You need cluster-admin rights**, since setup installs cluster-scoped resources (CRDs, ClusterRoleBindings) for Strimzi and ArgoCD.
* **You are responsible for making Gitea reachable for each lesson.** Before running any of the individual lesson `prep.sh` scripts you'll need to setup a port-forward so Gitea is exposed on port `3001`. You can do this by running the following command in a separate terminal and leaving it running for the duration of the tutorial:


  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward svc/gitea-http -n gitea 3001:3000
  ```

`setup.sh` and every lesson's `prep.sh` always print the Gitea address they actually used.

## Starting a lesson

After setup completes, follow the lesson guide of your choice:
* [Lesson 1: Your First GitOps Change](../../docs/gitops-tutorial/lesson-1.md)
* [Lesson 2: Promoting Changes Across Environments](../../docs/gitops-tutorial/lesson-2.md)
* [Lesson 3: Rolling Back a Bad Change](../../docs/gitops-tutorial/lesson-3.md)

## Teardown

When you are done with all lessons:

* If you used `--create-cluster` - delete the KinD cluster to remove everything:

  ```bash
  00-setup/teardown.sh --delete-cluster
  ```

* Otherwise (existing-cluster mode, the default), remove just the resources this tutorial installed, leaving the rest of the cluster untouched:

  ```bash
  00-setup/teardown.sh
  ```

## Troubleshooting

**Docker is not running**
Start Docker Desktop or your container runtime and run `./setup.sh --create-cluster` again.

**Port 3001 is already in use**
Another application is using port 3001. Stop that application, or (when using `--create-cluster`) change the port in `kind-config.yaml` (update both `hostPort` and the `nodePort` in `gitea/deployment.yaml` to match).

**Gitea is not reachable (existing-cluster mode)**
When not using `--create-cluster`, nothing automatically exposes Gitea's NodePort on your machine. Leave a port-forward running for the duration of the tutorial: `kubectl port-forward svc/gitea-http -n gitea 3001:3000`.

**Kafka cluster is not becoming ready**
Kafka takes a few minutes to start, especially on machines with limited resources. Check pod status:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kafka-tutorial
kubectl describe kafka my-cluster -n kafka-tutorial
```
